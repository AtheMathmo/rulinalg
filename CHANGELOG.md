# Change Log

This document will be used to keep track of changes made between release versions. I'll do my best to note any breaking changes!

## 0.3.0

This is a large release which refactors most of the `matrix` module.
We modify the `BaseSlice` trait to encompass `Matrix` functionality too - hence
renaming it `BaseMatrix`. The motivation behind this is to allow us to be generic
over `Matrix`/`MatrixSlice`/`MatrixSliceMut`.

### Breaking Changes

- Refactor `BaseSlice` trait as `BaseMatrix`. Implement this trait for `Matrix` too.
- Much of the `Matrix` functionality is now implemented behind the `BaseMatrix` trait. 
It will need to be `use`d to access this functionality.

### Features

- Add a new `BaseMatrixMut` trait for `Matrix` and `MatrixSliceMut`.
- Many methods which were previously for `Matrix` only or for `MatrixSlice(Mut)` only now
work with both!

### Minor Changes

- Fixing a bug in the `sub_slice` method.
- Modifying some unsafe code to use equivalent iterators instead.
- More benchmarks for wider performance regression coverage.

## 0.2.2

### Breaking Changes

### Breaking Changes

- None

### Features

- Adding new `get_row_*` methods for all `Matrix` types. Includes
mutable and unchecked `get` functions.

### Minor Changes

- None

## 0.2.0

### Breaking Changes

- Upper Hessenberg decomposition now consumes the input `Matrix` (instead of cloning at the start).

### Features

- Added Bidiagonal decomposition.
- Added Singular Value Decomposition.

### Minor Changes

- Fixed a bug where `get_unchecked_mut` returned `&T` instead of `&mut T`.

## 0.1.0

This release marks the separation of rulinalg from [rusty-machine](https://github.com/AtheMathmo/rusty-machine).

Rulinalg is now its own crate!
